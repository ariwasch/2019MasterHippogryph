This is the Power Hawks code from 2019: DEEP SPACE! It includes vision code for sandstorm using a Pixycam in pixy.java.
The Pixycam lines up with the white tape with a 1.4 inch margin of error so the drivers can place and pickup a hatchpannel with ease.
This code won us the autonomous award at the Owings Mills qualifier.
